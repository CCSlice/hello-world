# hello-world
Hi Everyone!
This is my first foray into the GitHub environment
One of the reasons that I am using GitHub is to learn from others.  I have a professional background that is not as good as it should be. 
I love databases, analyzing data, processes and leveraging the data to answer a myriad of questions for businesses?  Is such knowledge available on GitHub?  I don't know.  But I am eager to find out!
